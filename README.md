# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI, where the development server would randomly crash without providing any error messages in the console.  The issue was intermittent, making debugging challenging.  The solution implemented addresses the unexpected crashes and improves the stability of the development environment.

## Bug Description

The Expo CLI development server would unexpectedly terminate without any clear indication of the cause. Standard troubleshooting techniques (computer restarts, cache clearing) failed to resolve the issue.

## Solution

The root cause was identified as an incompatibility between a specific third-party library and the Expo SDK version.  The solution involves updating the problematic library to the latest version, ensuring compatibility and resolving the server crashes. This improved the stability of the development environment and made the workflow much more predictable.
