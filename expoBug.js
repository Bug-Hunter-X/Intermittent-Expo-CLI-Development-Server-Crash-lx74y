While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any apparent error messages in the console. This would happen intermittently, making development frustrating and unpredictable. The project was a relatively simple React Native application, so complex configurations shouldn't have been the cause.  I tried standard troubleshooting steps like restarting the computer and clearing the cache but the problem persisted.
